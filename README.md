ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Olivier

Iâ€™m interested in software obviously. I worked as developper for a Japanese company called Nireco from 2001 to 2006, mainly in C++ through the Borland IDE. 

Iâ€™m on the learning curve, as we all are.
                                     Or are we? 
  
Iâ€™m interested in web developpement as well as Python.

I am found of Japan, and its language, and also I have some basics of Chinese. I am especially inetrersting in anything related to kanji, hanzi, and the fonts used to dispaly ideograms. 

I passed the Udacity Nanodegree program on AI product management in July 21, because I am curious about how AI works but also how AI products are brought to life.
